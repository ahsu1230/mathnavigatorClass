Project Outline
Session 3
Floating images and texts
-------------------------------

Take the project from session 2...

Add an image of your choosing to your <html> file
Make sure the image is in an "assets" folder.

From here,

Have the image be on the left side using CSS { float: left; }
While text wraps around it using CSS { float: right; }

Try it the other way around (text on left, image on right) to see what happens.
