Project Outline
Session 1
-------------------------------

Play around with what you learned in class.

Try out the following:

- Create an index.html

- Link a css and javascript file to index.html
- Give your website a <title>


In your <body>

- Create a <h1>, see the differences with <h2>, <h3>, <h4>, etc.
- Create a <p>
- Create a few <span>
- Create a <div>

For every html attribute you just created,
see if you can style them by using CSS styling properties in your CSS file.
No styling should be done in your index.html file.

Download a font family from https://fonts.google.com/ into a "fonts" folder.
See if you can use CSS to have your entire website use this font you just downloaded.
