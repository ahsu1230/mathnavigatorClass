Instagram Header
-------------------------------

Take a look at www.instagram.com
Observe the header...
To the left, there is the logo icon & "Instagram".
To the right, are several icons a user can click on.

For now, ignore the search bar in the middle.
Your objective is to re-create the Instagram header from scratch.

In the assets folder, I have attached icon images that are used on the actual Instagram page.
Create the header with the following specifications:



//////////////
// Header
//////////////
The header has the following specifications:
The height of the header is exactly 25px.
The width of the header is the width of the window.
(Hint: remember, there are 2 ways to set the width/height of an element.)

There is a padding inside the header of:
20px top and bottom
26px left and right

There is a background color of: #FFFFFF (white)

Finally, there is a gray border at the bottom of the header.
It is 1px thick, and colored #DBDBDB
You may Google how to do this part! :)
I only want the bottom border, not the whole thing.

From here, it is recommended to have 2 <div> inside this header element.
One for the left stuff and one for the right stuff.


//////////////
// Instagram Icon & Logo (Left)
//////////////
There are 3 assets to the left side:
The Instagram camera icon, a vertical line, and the "Instagram" logo.

The camera icon is sized 24px x 24px
The vertical line is sized: 0.5px x 28px, using color #000000 (hint: use a <div> element to create this line)
The logo is 103px x 29px



//////////////
// Icon Links (Right)
//////////////
There are 3 icons: a compass, a heart, and a user
Each of these link to another page of the website. But for now, you don't need to worry about this.

Each of the icons are sized 24px by 24px.

The icons are spaced 30px away from each other.



//////////////
// Rest of the page (content)
//////////////

We are only doing the header for this project, so the body can be mostly left alone.
We just need a background color of: #FAFAFA



//////////////
// Bonus!!!
//////////////
(1) For each of the icons and logo...
When a user hovers their mouse over the icon,
the mouse cursor should change to a pointy-hand sign.
Try it on the real website to see what I mean!

*Hint: For each of the icons, it should only be one additional CSS line!


(2) Go on the Instagram website. Try to extract and download the icon images yourself.

*Hint: Instagram does icons in an interesting way.
Basically you should end up with one large, composite image that contains all the small icons.
Look for this one large image! It's a .png file.
When you can download this file, come see me and I'll tell you more and why this happens!


(3) Try making the Search bar
The total dimensions of this bar is 215px by 28px.
The border is 1px thick with color #DBDBDB.
The background color is #FAFAFA.
Inside the search bar there is a padding of 7px.

The "Search" font is color #999999 and font size 14px. The font face/family is Arial.
The Search icon is sized 10px x 10px and spaced 6 px left of the text.
When you hover over the search bar, you should get a "text input" cursor.

Observe how the "Search" icon and text are centered in the search bar.
